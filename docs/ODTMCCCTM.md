# Common Cloud Computing Threat Model (CCCTM)

It is legacy. Use the [ACCTM threat model](ODTMACCTP.md) instead.

This model is an example of domain-specific threat model. 
It depicts some common threats to cloud systems.
The model is implemented as a OWL ontology.

* [OWL file](../OdTMCCCTM.owl)

Note: please use [old version of the base model](../old/OdTMBaseThreatModelv02.owl) with this one.

There is also the similar model, 
implemented as a [threat template](https://github.com/nets4geeks/CCCTM_template) 
in the XML format for the Microsoft Threat Modelling (TM) tool.

It can be used to prove different ideas (see below). 
Also if someone made a decision to create an opensource, ontology-driven alternative to Microsoft TM,
the CCCTM ontology could be used to test the software means.

Note, that it does not have a countermeasure hierarchy.
