# Applications for the OdTM framework

## OdTM Server

Here very first steps have been made. It allows to load the base model,
a set of domain models and test them against semantic interpretations of DFD, like [this one](OdTMServer/cases/01verysimplecase).

To compile & run the application:

-clone the whole repository [https://github.com/nets4geeks/OdTM.git](https://github.com/nets4geeks/OdTM.git),
go to the 'applications/OdTMServer' folder and run 'mvn compile' there.

-edit 'server.properties' and execute the 'run' script there.
