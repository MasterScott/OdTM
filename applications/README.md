# Applications for the OdTM framework

## OdTM Server

Here very first steps have been made. 

Anyway to compile & run the application: 

-clone the whole repository (https://github.com/nets4geeks/OdTM.git)[https://github.com/nets4geeks/OdTM.git],
go to the applications/OdTMServer folder and run 'mvn compile' there. 

-edit server.properties and the run script (e.g. test it against a very simple [use case](OdTMServer/cases/01verysimplecase).
