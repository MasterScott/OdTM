# Applications for the OdTM framework

## OdTM Server

The OdTM Server implements an ontology-driven threat rule engine.
Our plans include creation of the JSON-based remote API application, 
aimed to perform automatic threat modelling on a given system description 
through a domain-specific threat model.

[Description is here](OdTMServer/README.md)
